## Transferability to Book Reviews {#transferability-book-reviews}

### Norm of Reciprocity {#norm-reciprocity}

Gouldner's _norm of reciprocity_ states “that a social unit or group is more likely to contribute to another which provides it with benefits than to one which does not” (Gouldner, 1960, p. 170). In its core, the norm of reciprocity is based on a mutual exchange between two subjects / groups.

Mainly, Kim et al. argue that incentivization – here in terms of receiving a non-monetary incentive in form of a free sample product – elicits the norm of reciprocity and that, consequently, the reviewers feel indebted and as such obliged to return something to their giver, in this case by “positively stating their consumption experience and by recommending the product to others” (Kim et al., 2019, p. 115).

They infer the following hypotheses:<br>
**H1a** Sponsored reviews are more positive than organic reviews.<br>
**H1b** Sponsored reviewers are more likely to recommend the product than organic reviewers.<br>

The norm of reciprocity can be interpreted as being “an innate [human] tendency” (ibid.). As a consequence, it may be argued that book reviewers also – unconsciously – adhere to the norm of reciprocity when writing book reviews in exchange for having
received a free review copy. This applies even more when considering the closeness of the Social Reading book world (cf. Background-chapter) – presumably, the social ties between reviewer and publisher/author are more intimate than between a manufacturer and reviewer of cosmetic products.

Both hypotheses are transferable.

### Self-fulfilling Prophecy {#self-fulfilling-prophecy}

**H2a** Sponsored reviews are more complex than organic reviews.<br>
**H2b** Sponsored reviews are more elaborate than organic reviews.<br>

### Reviewer Motivations {#reviewer-motivations}

**H3a** Sponsored reviews are less extreme than organic reviews, i.e., they show a lower proportion of 1-star or 5-star reviews in their star rating distribution, compared to
organic reviews.<br>
**H3b** Sponsored reviews are more objective than organic reviews.<br>


### Review Perception {#review-perception}
**H4** Sponsored reviews are perceived as less helpful than organic reviews. <br>

## Selected Hypotheses {#selected-hypotheses}
Although all original hypotheses are transferable to the domain of book reviews, with respect to the scope of the thesis and other limiting factors such as data availability, the following hypotheses are derived from Kim et al.:

**H1** Incentivized book reviews are more positive than non-incentivized book reviews.<br>
**H2** Incentivized book reviews are more complex than non-incentivized book reviews.<br>
**H3** Incentivized book reviews are more elaborate than non-incentivized book reviews.<br>
**H4** Incentivized book reviews are less extreme than non-incentivized book reviews.<br>
**H5** Incentivized book reviews are more objective than non-incentivized book reviews.
