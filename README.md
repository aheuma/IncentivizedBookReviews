# Purpose of this Repository

This repository is the basis of a web-based presentation of my master thesis which was developed in the context of my master program "Digitale Methodik in den Geistes- und Kulturwissenschaften" (Digital Humanities) at the Johannes Gutenberg-University and the Hochschule Mainz.

The website was created using GitHub Pages, Jekyll and the [alembic](https://github.com/daviddarnes/alembic/tree/main?tab=MIT-1-ov-file) theme by David Darnes.
