This repository is the basis of a web-based presentation of my master thesis which was developed in the context of the master program "Digitale Methodik in den Geistes- und Kulturwissenschaften" (Digital Humanities) at Johannes Gutenberg-University and Hochschule Mainz.

The website was created using GitHub Pages, Jekyll and the [alembic](https://github.com/daviddarnes/alembic/tree/main?tab=MIT-1-ov-file) theme by David Darnes.

# MA Thesis

The thesis analyzes the impact of incentivization on German book reviews, in terms of review copies which are send by publishers/authors to literary critics, in this case: lay reviewers on LovelyBooks. The main question is whether incentivized book reviews show signs of influence if the reviewer received a review copy. The reviews are compared in terms of their positivity, complexity, elaborateness, extremeness, and objectivity.
