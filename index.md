## Short Summary
The thesis analyzes the impact of incentivization on book reviews, in terms of review copies which are send by publishers/authors to literary critics, in this case: lay reviewers on LovelyBooks. The main question is whether incentivized book reviewers show signs of being influenced by having received a review copy. The reviews are compared in terms of their positivity, complexity, elaborateness, extremeness, and objectivity.
