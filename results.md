## Hypothesis Testing {#hypothesis-testing}
Generally, to test the hypotheses, the following steps are necessary:
1. Compare mean/median scores
2. Check test assumptions
3. Conduct hypothesis test
4. Calculate effect size

In the following, all results are reported apart from the test assumptions (you can read about this in the thesis).

#### Hypothesis 1 {#hypothesis-1}

| **Measure** | **IR** | **NIR** |
| --- | ---|---|
| Mean | 0.2612 | **0.2775** |
| SD | 0.1249 | 0.1788 |

<br>Due to the contrary tendency as indicated by the mean scores, hypothesis _H1_ is rejected. Instead, the alternative hypothesis—_H1b NIRs are more positive than IRs_—is tested.

| **Measure** | **Value** |
| --- | ---|
| p | 0.0103 |
| d | 0.047 |

<br>With p < 0.05, the difference between the groups is statistically significant (_H1b_ is confirmed). Still, with a very small effect size of 0.047, the difference is considered to have no practical relevance.

#### Hypothesis 2 {#hypothesis-2}

| **Measure** | **IR** | **NIR** |
| --- | ---|---|
| Mean | 5.2486 | **5.2886** |
| SD | 0.2718 | 0.4158 |

<br>Due to the contrary tendency as indicated by the mean scores, hypothesis _H2_ is rejected. Instead, the alternative hypothesis—_H2b NIRs are more complex than IRs_—is tested.

| **Measure** | **Value** |
| --- | ---|
| p | 0.0233 |
| d | 0.04 |

<br>With p < 0.05, the difference between the groups is statistically significant (_H2b_ is confirmed). Still, with a very small effect size of 0.04, the difference is considered to have no practical relevance.

#### Hypothesis 3 {#hypothesis-3}

| **Measure** | **IR** | **NIR** |
| --- | ---|---|
| Mean | **475.8192** | 327.6587 |
| SD | 311.3817 | 280.9906 |

<br>The mean tendency supports the initial hypothesis.

| **Measure** | **Value** |
| --- | ---|
| p | 0.00 |
| d | 0.64 |

<br>With p < 0.001[^1], the difference between the groups is statistically highly significant (_H3_ is confirmed). Even more, with an effect size of 0.64, the difference is considered to have considerable practical relevance.

#### Hypothesis 4 {#hypothesis-4}

| **Measure** | **IR** | **NIR** |
| --- | ---|---|
| Median | 5 | **4** |

<br>In this case, the median scores are compared because there are ordinal variables. Due to the contrary tendency, hypothesis _H4_ is rejected. Instead, the alternative hypothesis—_H4b NIRs are less extreme than IRs_—is tested.

| **Measure** | **Value** |
| --- | ---|
| p | 0.0001 |

<br>With p < 0.001, the difference between the groups is statistically highly significant. Therefore, the relative frequencies of the 1- and 5-star category is compared: 

| **Review Type** | ⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| --- | ---| ---|
| IR | **0.965** | 52.648 | 
| NIR | 1.375 | **47.989** |

<br>The relative frequencies show ambivalent results: While there are indeed less 1-star reviews, there are more 5-star reviews in the IR sample. Thus, hypothesis _H4b_ is rejected.

#### Hypothesis 5 {#hypothesis-5}

| **Measure** | **IR** | **NIR** |
| --- | ---|---|
| Mean | **91.7514** | 91.3303 |
| SD | 2.0898 | 3.8464 |

<br>The mean tendency supports the initial hypothesis.

| **Measure** | **Value** |
| --- | ---|
| p | 0.498 |

<br>With p > 0.05, the difference between the groups is not statistically significant. Thus, _H5_ is rejected.

#### Summary {#summary}

| **Hypothesis** | **Status** | **Relevant?** |
| --- | ---|---|
| H1: IRs are more positive than NIRs | Rejected | - |
| H1b: NIRs are more positive than IRs | Confirmed | No |
| H2: IRs are more complex than NIRs | Rejected | - |
| H2b: NIRs are more complex than IRs | Confirmed | No |
| H3: IRs are more elaborate than NIRs | Confirmed | Yes |
| H4: IRs are less extreme than NIRs | Rejected | - |
| H4b: NIRs are less extreme than IRs | Rejected | - |
| H5: IRs are more objective than NIRs | Rejected | - |

<br>Note: "Status" reflects either the outcome of a) the comparison of mean / median scores; or b) the results of the hypotheses tests. The column "Relevant?" refers to the effect size (if computed) and whether the significant difference is considered to be relevant.

Only one of the five initial hypotheses could be confirmed: _H3_. The other four hypotheses were rejected. The two alternative hypotheses _H1b_ and _H2b_ were found to be statistically significant. At the same time, effect size indicates that the difference has no practical relevance. In case of _H4b_, a significant association was found, but with respect to the relative frequencies of the two respective star rating categories, the hypothesis was rejected.

Finally, the following table summarizes the hypotheses concepts and whether a relevant difference was found:

| **Hypothesis Concept** | **Difference?** 
| --- | --- |
| Positivity | ❌ |
| Complexity | ❌ |
| Elaborateness | ✅ |
| Extremeness | ❌ |
| Objectivity | ❌ |


<br>This is the basis for the following discussion.

## Discussion {#discussion}
**Hypothesis 1**
<br>Book reviewers do not feel to obliged to give anything more in return for the free copy than their opinion. Even more, positive publicity might be more relevant for other product types than books; in the latter case, even negative publicity might be valuable. This could explain why IRs and NIRs do not differ with respect to positivity.

**Hypotheses 2 & 3**
<br>Book reviewers might not be aware of the possible danger of adding a disclosure statement to their reviews; thus, the underlying assumption of „self-fulfilling prophecy“ can be rejected. At the same time, an explanation for the confirmation of H3 could be the aforementioned _norm of reciprocity_.

**Hypothesis 4**
<br>Reviewer motivations, while certainly different for incentivized and non-incentivized reviewers, are not reflected by extreme star ratings.

**Hypothesis 5**
<br>It can be assumed that book reviewers develop an uniform writing style in reviews. Therefore, it does not make a difference whether the review is published shortly after the product experience or not.

## Conclusion {#conclusion}
❓ Do incentivized book reviews show signs of influence if the reviewer received a free book copy?

❗ Incentivization indeed impacts the contents of book reviews, but the only form of impact that has been found is an influence on review elaborateness (in terms of review length). At the same time, book reviews do not differ with respect to positivity, complexity, extremeness, and objectivity.

However, the phenomenon of „influence“ needs further investigation because there might be more dimensions than just the five considered in this thesis. Also, a conclusion such as „longer reviews are influenced“ is abridged.

**Limitations**
<br>The findings are only valid with respect to this study’s product type, genre, language, reviewing platform, and temporal limitation.

**Further Research Perspectives**
- different formalisation and operationalisation of the concepts
- repeat analysis with sentence-based data
- try to avoid misclassification of NIRs
- use different NIR sample
- avoid biases by analyzing intra-reviewer or intra-book differences
- analyze a different genre
- derive hypotheses from book market-specifics
etc.
